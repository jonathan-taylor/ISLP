# Khan Gene Data

The data consists of a number of tissue samples corresponding to
four distinct types of small round blue cell tumors. For each
tissue sample, 2308 gene expression measurements are available.

     
## Format

The format is a dict containing four components: `xtrain`,
`xtest`, `ytrain`, and `ytest`. `xtrain` contains the 2308 gene
expression values for 63 subjects and `ytrain` records the
corresponding tumor type. `ytrain` and `ytest` contain the
corresponding testing sample information for a further 20
subjects.

## Notes

This data were originally reported in:

Berthold F, Schwab M, Antonescu C, Peterson C, and Meltzer P.

expression profiling and artificial neural networks. Nature
Medicine, v.7, pp.673-679, 2001.

The data were also used in:
