# ANOVA using `ModelSpec`


In this lab we illustrate how to run create specific ANOVA analyses
using `ModelSpec`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

from statsmodels.api import OLS
from statsmodels.stats.anova import anova_lm

from ISLP import load_data
from ISLP.models import (ModelSpec,
                         derived_feature,
                         summarize)
```

### Forward Selection
 
We will  apply the forward-selection approach to the  `Hitters` 
data.  We wish to predict a baseball player’s `Salary` on the
basis of various statistics associated with performance in the
previous year.

```{code-cell} ipython3
Hitters = load_data('Hitters')
np.isnan(Hitters['Salary']).sum()
```

    
 We see that `Salary` is missing for 59 players. The
`dropna()`  method of data frames removes all of the rows that have missing
values in any variable (by default --- see  `Hitters.dropna?`).

```{code-cell} ipython3
Hitters = Hitters.dropna()
Hitters.columns
```

## Grouping variables

A look at the [description](https://islp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasets/Hitters.html) of the data shows
that there are both career and 1986 offensive stats, as well as some defensive stats.

Let's group the offensive into recent and career offensive stats, as well as a group of defensive variables.

```{code-cell} ipython3
offense_1986 = derived_feature(['AtBat', 'Hits', 'HmRun', 'Runs', 'RBI', 'Walks'],
                               name='offense_1986')
offense_career = derived_feature(['CAtBat', 'CHits', 'CHmRun', 'CRuns', 'CRBI', 'CWalks'],
                                 name='offense_career')
defense_1986 = derived_feature(['PutOuts', 'Assists', 'Errors'],
                               name='defense_1986')
confounders = derived_feature(['Division', 'League', 'NewLeague'],
                              name='confounders')
```

We'll first do a sequential ANOVA where terms are added sequentially

```{code-cell} ipython3
design = ModelSpec([confounders, offense_1986, defense_1986, offense_career]).fit(Hitters)
Y = np.array(Hitters['Salary'])
X = design.transform(Hitters)
```

Along with a score we need to specify the search strategy. This is done through the object
`Stepwise()`  in the `ISLP.models` package. The method `Stepwise.first_peak()`
runs forward stepwise until any further additions to the model do not result
in an improvement in the evaluation score. Similarly, the method `Stepwise.fixed_steps()`
runs a fixed number of steps of stepwise search.

```{code-cell} ipython3
M = OLS(Y, X).fit()
summarize(M)
```

We'll first produce the sequential, or Type I ANOVA results. This builds up a model sequentially and compares
two successive models.

```{code-cell} ipython3
anova_lm(*[OLS(Y, D).fit() for D in design.build_sequence(Hitters, anova_type='sequential')])
```

We can similarly compute the Type II ANOVA results which drops each term and compares to the full model.

```{code-cell} ipython3
D_full = design.transform(Hitters)
OLS_full = OLS(Y, D_full).fit()
dfs = []
for d in design.build_sequence(Hitters, anova_type='drop'):
    dfs.append(anova_lm(OLS(Y,d).fit(), OLS_full).iloc[1:])
df = pd.concat(dfs)
df.index = design.names
df
```
